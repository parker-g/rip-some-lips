        <h1>you're knot losing any fish today.</h1>
        <p>here's a collection of knots you'll surely not ever forget!</p>
        <section class="knotcontainer">
            <h2>clinch knot</h2>

            <ol class="knot-instructions">
                <li>First, guide your line through the eye of the lure. Be sure to pull 3-5 inches of line through.</li>
                <li>Now, begin wrapping that excess line around the main line. <em>BE SURE</em> to leave a hole of space between the eye of the lure and your first wrap. Around six wraps should do the trick.</li>
                <li>After completing the amount of wraps you desire, take the end of your line and feed it through the hole you left in step two.</li>
                <li>Now, pull your line tight.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>improved clinch knot</h2>
            <img class="knot-img" src="images/knots/improved_clinch.png" alt="improved clinch knot illustration">
            <p class="subheader"><strong>the improved clinch is almost identical to a clinch knot, only differing in the last step.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by guiding your line through the eye, creating 3-5 inches of excess.</li>
                <li>Next, begin wrapping the excess around the main line. Again, <em>BE SURE</em> to leave a hole of space between the eye of the lure and your first wrap.</li>
                <li>After completing six to eight wraps around the main line, feed the tip of your line into the hole you left in the previous step.</li>
                <li>Now, feed the tip of your line through the pocket you just created.</li>
                <li>Finally, you can pull your line tight. Not too bad right?</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="knotcontainer">
            <h2>palomar knot</h2>
            <img class="knot-img" src="images/knots/palomar-cleaned.png" alt="palomar knot illustration">
            <p class="subheader"><strong>palomar knot is strong and simple.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by doubling up your line, folding it in on itself to create around 6 inches of doubled line.</li>
                <li>Now, feed the doubled line through the eye of the lure.</li>
                <li>Perform an overhand knot, better known as a loop de loop, with the doubled line.</li>
                <li>Finally, pass the lure through the head of the doubled line.</li>
                <li>Now pull 'er tight!</li>

    <ul class="tips">
        <li>when it gets hot out during summer, fish tend to seek refuge from the heat just like humans. you'll find that bass move deeper under the water level or hang out closer to shade during may, june, and july.</li>
        <li>if you know fish are there, keep on casting, and don't be afraid to try something new. it can take a long time to get a fish's attention.</li>
        <li>keep track of fish spawning, or mating, seasons. often, the easiest time to catch fish is when they're spawning. mothers are quicker to bite because they're protecting their fry (baby fish).</li>
